A TypeScript module that lets you have both scroll snapping and native scrolling functionality in different sections of your website.

**Demo link**: https://syrian-open-source.github.io/custom-snap/

## Features

-   Lightweight and simple (0 dependencies)
-   Works with both fullpage sections (100vh) and variable height sections.
-   You can customize the snap scrolling's duration and easing presets
-   You can have as many normal scroll sections as you want.

## Installation

```sh
npm install custom-snap
```

## Example usage

**HTML structure**

```html
<div id="container">
	<div id="a" class="section"></div>
	<div id="b" class="section"></div>
	<div id="c" class="section long-content"></div>
	<div id="d" class="section"></div>
	<div id="e" class="section long-content"></div>
	<div id="f" class="section"></div>
</div>
```

**CSS**

```css
/* Height values are arbitrary. You can choose any height you want */
.section {
	height: 100vh;
}

.long-content {
	height: 200vh;
}
```

**JS**

```js
import { CustomSnap } from "custom-snap";

const scrollInstance = new CustomSnap({
	containerID: "container",
	normalScrollElementIDs: ["c", "e"],
	afterSnap: (id, section) => {},
	beforeSnap: (id, section) => {},
});

scrollInstance.register();
```

In this example, sections with ids `c` and `d` will have normal scrolling, while all other children of `#container` will have snap scrolling.

**Important!**: You have to specify an ID on every child of the container.

### Indexing

Section `a` has index 0, `b` has index 1, and so on... Section `f` has index 5.

This is useful in case you want to scroll programmatically using the `scrollToSectionByIndex` method.

## Options

| Key                    | Description                                                         | Type              | Default value   |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------- | --------------- |
| containerID            | ID of the wrapping container                                        | `string`          | none            |
| hideScrollbar          | Whether to hide the browser's scrollbar or not                      | `boolean`         | `false`         |
| normalScrollElementIDs | IDs of the sections to which scroll snapping doesn't apply          | `string[]`        | `[]`            |
| snapDuration           | The duration that scroll snapping takes in milliseconds             | `number`          | `1000` (ms)     |
| easingPreset           | The transition timing function that gets applied to snapping        | `EasingPreset`    | `easeInOutQuad` |
| afterSnap              | A function that gets called after snap scrolling is performed       | `OnEventCallback` | `() => {}`      |
| beforeSnap             | A function that gets called just before snap scrolling is performed | `OnEventCallback` | `() => {}`      |

## Instance methods

```ts
/**
 * Sets a new easing preset for snap scrolling
 */
setEasingPreset(easingPreset: EasingPreset): void

/**
 * Sets a new duration for snap scrolling
 */
setSnapDuration(duration = 1000): void

/**
 * Returns the scroll's direction
 */
getScrollDirection(): ScrollDirection

/**
 * Hides the browser's scrollbar using CSS
 */
hideScrollbar(): void

/**
 * Shows the browser's scrollbar
 */
showScrollbar(): void

/**
 * Scrolls to a specific section over a period of time.
 */
scrollToSectionByIndex(index: number, duration = 1000): void

/**
 * Registers the snap scroll event listener.
 * Note that without invoking this function, all scrolling
 * would be considered normal.
 */
register(): void

/**
 * Removes the currently bound scroll event listener.
 * After unregistering, all scrolling would be considered normal.
 */
unregister(): void
```

## Types

```ts
type EasingPreset = "easeInOutQuad" | "easeInCubic" | "inOutQuintic";
type ScrollDirection = "top-to-bottom" | "bottom-to-top" | "";

interface OnEventCallback {
	(id?: number, section?: HTMLElement | null): void;
}
```
